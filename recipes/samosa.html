    <h1>Samosa</h1>
    <img src="samosa.webp" width="100%">
    <p>A samosa or singara is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, including ingredients such as
        spiced potatoes, onions, and peas. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes,
        depending on the region. Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times
        or earlier

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup oil</li>
        <li>2 small onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coriander seed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>4 prepared pie crusts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and
            simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a bowl; coarsely mash</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions, coriander seed, curry powder, ginger,
            salt, turmeric, cumin, allspice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon until onion is lightly browned, about 5
            minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir tomatoes and peas into onion mixture; pour into mashed potatoes
            and thoroughly mix. Cool completely.</li>
        <li>Cut each pie crust into 8 even triangles. Spoon filling onto the wide end of each triangle; fold corners
            over filling creating a triangular 'hat' shape. Pinch the dough together to form a seal. Brush egg white
            over each samosa and arrange on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until samosas are golden brown, about 15 minutes</li>
    </ol>
