    <h1>Biryani</h1>
    <img src="biryani.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It is made
        with Indian spices, rice, and usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, fish) or in some
        cases without any meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Fried Onions</li>
        <li>Ginger Garlic Paste</li>
        <li>Basmati Rice</li>
        <li>Ground Spices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fried onions are a key ingredient here, and itâ€™s important to get this right. Onions are cut into slices and
            then browned on medium flame in oil. They don't need to be extra crispy, but onions should be a deep golden
            brown without getting burnt.</li>
        <li>The basmati rice is cooked for exactly 5 minutes in boiling water with whole spices and salt to get it to
            the right doneness - which is 70%. Drain the rice well to get rid of any excess water.</li>
        <li>We are using yogurt as a tenderiser, fried onions (birista), tomato puree, red chili powder, turmeric
            powder, coriander powder, garam masala and salt to flavor the chicken.</li>
        <li>It's important to marinate the chicken in a large bowl for at least two hours or overnight for the maximum
            flavor.</li>
        <li>Once you have your chicken marinated, rice and fried onions ready, start by cooking the marinated chicken.
            To cook the chicken, place it in the dutch oven or a large pot that you plan to use for cooking the biryani,
            and cook them for 7 minutes. There is no need to stir the chicken, only flip it once around the 4 minute
            mark.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is partially cooked, the next step is to layer it with the fried onions, mint and
            coriander.The final step is layering with 70% cooked basmati rice. Sprinkle saffron milk and ghee on top and
            cover tightly with a lid.</li>
        <li>And there you go! The whole thing takes approximately an hour so I call this a weekend project, but after
            you've done it once, you'll realize how easy and simple making biryani at home is!</li>
    </ol>
