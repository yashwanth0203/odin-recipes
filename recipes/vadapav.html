    <h1>VadaPav</h1>
    <img src="vadapav.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>Vada pav, alternatively spelt wada pao, is a vegetarian fast food dish native to the state of
        Maharashtra. The dish consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun (pav) sliced almost in
        half through the middle. It is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chili pepper.
        Although it originated as an affordable street food in Mumbai, it is now served in food stalls and restaurants
        across India.
